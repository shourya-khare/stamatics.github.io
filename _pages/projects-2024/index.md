## 1 - A Reconstruction of Analysis
* **Mentors :** Mohd Sufyan
* **Project Area :** Metric Topology, Real Analysis, Measure Theory
* **Description :** "The project aims to be a self-sufficient development of analysis upto Riemann-Stieltjes integration in one variable via metric topology. Mentees will further be introduced to
weaknesses in the Riemann integral followed up with introductory Measure Theory (Borel Sets and Lebesgue Measure on R). The project aims to be rigorous until the Riemann Integral, beyond which it will turn more expository.

The project aims at filling that gap between high school calculus and undergraduate analysis, and further, introducing mentees to the backend machinery of analysis that is measure theory. Exposing them to ideas of measure will help form a much more rigid foundation in their minds for any further ventures in the subject."

Then basic and complex option strategies like long put, straddle, butterfly, iron condor, etc. Then we will be doing the backtesting on real data by applying these strategies to check their performance. After it we will proceed to stock movement trends analysis using momentum, volume and volatility, impact of market news and events, finding resistance and support levels,etc. Introducing to importance of risk management in option trading and how to hedge portfolio against adverse price movements.

## 8 - Bayesian Analysis & Inference  
* **Mentors :** Lavesh Gupta 
* **Project Area :** Probabilistic Modelling

* **Description :** "Dive into the world of probabilistic thinking! This project will uncover the secrets of probability and statistics, through programming. We'll begin by exploring the fundamentals of Bayesian statistics, a framework that incorporates prior knowledge, and see how it unlocks new possibilities in data analysis. 

We'll then delve into probabilistic programming, a revolutionary approach that lets you code with probability itself! Using cutting-edge libraries like PyMC and ArviZ, we'll build sophisticated hierarchical models that capture complex relationships within your data. Additionally, we'll re-visit familiar machine learning models like Linear Regression and Regression Trees from a fresh perspective, viewing them through the lens of probability."
